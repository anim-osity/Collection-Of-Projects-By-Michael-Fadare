Use the starting code and write a loop that replaces every occurrence of cat with dog.

public class ChallengeReplace
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
       String message = "I love cats! I have a cat named Coco. My cat's very smart!";

       // Write a loop here that replaces every occurrence of "cat"
       // in the message with "dog", using indexOf and substring.

 

       System.out.println(message);
   }
}
