* 75% - Write a for loop (looping 10 times) that generates 3 random numbers (between 1 and 50) and outputs the largest each time (with a useful print statement).
     "The largest number of (12, 43, 7) is 43"
* 15% - keep a running total of the largest number found each time you loop and print that total at the end
* 10% - Learn how to store the largest number of each cycle of the loop into an array and print the list of numbers at the end.
