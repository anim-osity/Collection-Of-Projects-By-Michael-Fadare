  (SWITCH CASES COMPARING STRINGS)

Example
Select Case strWarehouse
	Case “A”
		lblLocation.Text = “Tennessee”
	Case “B”
		lblLocation.Text = “Louisiana”
	Case “C”, “D”
		lblLocation.Text = “Kentucky”
	Case Else
		lblLocation.Text = “N/A”
End Select

(SWITCH CASES COMPARING INTS)

Example
Select Case intQuantity
	Case 1 to 5
		intPrice = 25
	Case 6 to 10
		intPrice = 23
	Case Is > 10
		intPrice = 20
	Case Else	
		intPrice = 0
End Select

(ToUpper and ToLower)

string.ToUpper - Converts the contents of the string to all uppercase letters
string.ToLower - Converts the contents of the string to all lowercase letters

Examples
StrName = strName.ToUpper
txtState.Text = txtState.Text.ToLower

(TRIM METHOD)

string.Trim - removes any leading and trailing spaces from the string

Examples
If txtState.Text.Trim.ToUpper = “LA” Then
txtName.Text = txtName.Text.Trim
(IF ELSE STATEMENT)

Example
If txtCode.Text.Trim.ToUpper = “FREESHIP” Then
	intShipping = 0 
Else 
	intShipping = 5
End If

(COMPARISON OPERATORS)

Operator                     Operation
=			equal to
>			greater than
>=			greater than or equal to
<			less than
<=			less than or equal to
<>			not equal to			

Examples
If strState = “IL” Then
If decHours > 40 Then
If decMax >= 75.65D Then
if  strContinue <> “N” Then
If blnIsInsured = True Then 

If intPurchased >= 5 Then 
dblDiscount = dbTotalDue * dbDISCOUNT_RATE
dblTotalDue = dbTotalDue - dblDiscount
End If

(LOGICAL OPERATORS)

Operator                     Operation
Not			reverses the truth-value of the condition; True becomes False and
False becomes True

And 			both the initial condition and everything after the initial condition must be                                                                                             
                                   True

AndAlso 		Basically same thing as And, except it’s a short-circuit evaluation(if the ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀left operand is true and so the entire expression is guaranteed to be true ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀the right operand won't even be evaluated) 

Or 			Only one of the subconditions has to be true for the compound condition 			            True  
                                                                                  
OrElse                         Same thing as Or, except it’s a short-circuit evaluation

Xor			One and only one of the subconditions has to be true for the compound ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀condition to be True           
                                     

Examples
If Not blnSenior Then 
(This condition is True when the variable’s boolean value is False, otherwise it’s False
Basically just:
IfblnSenior = False Then) 

If dblRate > 0 AndAlso dblRate < 0.15 Then

If strCode = “1” OrElse decSales > 499.99D Then  
(This compound condition is True if the strCode variable contains the string “1” or when the value of the decSales variable is greater than 4999.99; else it’s false)

If strCoupon1 = “USE” Xor strCoupon2 = “USE” Then
(This compound condition evaluates to True when only one of the variables contains “USE”, else it’s False)


 

















Mod - remainder

(HOW TO DEFINE VARIABLES)

Const statement- a value that cannot be changed while the application is running. 

Examples
Const dblPI As Double = 3.1459
(declares the variable as a Double named constant and initialize it to the Double number 3.1459

Dim dblRadius As Double
(Allows you to declare variable names and their types. 
Dim [Insert Variable Name] as [Insert data Type])

(TYPES OF CONVERSION)

Examples
Double.TryParse(txtRadius.Text, dlbRadius)
(Converts number values to String values 
Double.TryParse([String variable], [number variable])

Convert.toInt32(txtPrice.Text)
(Converts Strings as numbers 
Convert.toInt32([String variable])

(TOSTRING METHODS)

Format specifier                     Description
C or n (For Currency)		displays the string with a dollar sign and includes a thousands 					separator; negative values are enclosed with parentheses

N or n (Number)		similar to the Currency format but does not include a dollar sign 					and negative values have a minus sign

P or P (Percent)		multiples the number variable by 100 and formats the result with a 				percent sign; negative values are preceded with a minus sign

Examples
intSales = 75000
lblSales.text = int.Sales.ToString(“C2”)
(Assigns the “$75,000,000” as the string value for lblSales)



decTotal = 4599.639D
lblTotal.Text = decTotal.ToString(“N2”)
(Assigns the string “4,599.64” to lblTotal.Text)

dblRate = 0.15
lblRate.Text = dblRate.ToString(“P0”)
(Assigns the string “15 %” to the lblRate.Text)

(DO WHILE LOOPS)

Syntax
Do {While / Until} condition
[loop body]
Loop

Examples
Do While intNum <= 5
lblNums.Text = lbl.Text & intNum.Tostring & “       “
intNum += 1
Loop


Do Until intNUm > 5 
lblNums.Text = lbl.Text & intNum.Tostring & “       “
intNum += 1
Loop
