This is a collection of files that I created to help our robot compete in the 2021-2022 FIRST Tech Challenge.

Overview of the game:

The Freight Frenzy challenge features a variety of game elements such as freight, shipping hubs, carousels, warehouses, barriers and ducks. There are a variety of ways to obtain points during each of the 3 periods. Each robot starts against the Playing Field wall adjacent to the Alliance Station. Once each robot is in position, each team will progress through the thirty second autonomous period followed by the two minute long driver controlled period. The last thirty seconds of the match is the end game period. We set out to find the most efficient way to gain as many points as possible. 

*Autonmous period - Period in which the robot is controlled exclusively by the code

*Driver controlled period - Period in which the robot is manually controlled by the drivers
